## Review Information

### Demo Account

Not required — Tonic works entirely offline with no sign-in.

### Review Notes

Background Audio: The app plays audio while backgrounded and with the screen locked. This is core functionality for sleep use cases.

No Network Required: The app operates entirely offline. All sounds are generated algorithmically on-device or bundled as assets.

Consultation Quiz: On first launch, users are guided through an optional 3-question consultation (30 seconds) to determine their ideal tonic. Users who skip receive a default prescription and are gently prompted to personalize after their first session.

Audio Generation: Tonics (white/pink/brown noise) are generated in real-time using PCM synthesis—not pre-recorded loops.

### Testing Recommendations

1. Launch app and complete the consultation quiz
2. Select different tonics and botanicals from the Dispensary
3. Start playback and lock the device to verify background audio
4. Test lock screen controls (play/pause)
5. Verify timer countdown and automatic fade-out
6. Check volume safety indicator at different strength levels
